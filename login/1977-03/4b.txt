Dear Professor Ferentz,

     I wish to announce the existence of a detailed commentary on the UNIX
operating system (i.e. the UNIX resident nucleus), which I have written and
which should be of interest to many UNIX users.

     The commentary was prepared originally to enable my students to use UNIX as
an operating system case study, wherein the complete source of the resident code
is investigated.   The first version of the commentary is now being revised and
extended and the second version will be issued in book form.   The provisional
publication date is May, 1977.

     Details_______

     There are two volumes of approximately 100 pages each.   They will be
     produced by offset printing on size A4 paper after a 25% reduction from
     11" x 14" originals printed on a computer terminal.

     The first volume, "UNIX Operating System Source Code, Level Six" is an
     edited version of the resident code appropriate to a PDP11/40 with RK05
     disks, PC11 paper tape reader/punch, LP11 line printer and KL11/DL11
     terminal interfaces.    A cross-reference is included.

     The second volume, "Notes on the UNIX Operating System", contains a detailed
     commentary on the contents of the first volume.   There are twenty-six
     chapters, including a review of the PDP-11 architecture, a tutorial in
     reading "C" programs, and some suggestions for student exercises.    Two
     indices are included for reference purposes.
                                                             11.00
     The cost for a single set (two volumes) will be $A10.00, plus postage.
Postage costs from Australia based on a packet weighing 650 grams are as follows:

          Air-mail  (all countries) : $A7.70
          Surface Air Lifted (two to three weeks delivery time, to U.S.A.
                             UK, West Germany and Italy only) : $A3.40  3.74
          Surface mail (not recommended)  $A2.15.                             _______
                                                                             $ 14.75
     I would invite anyone covered by a UNIX license who is interested in         US
obtaining a copy, to write to me as soon as possible so that the size of the print
order can be determined.   Prepayment is requested, with cheques made out to
"School of Electrical Engineering, University of New South Wales".   Currently,
$A1.00 = $US1.10.  A declaration that the recipient is covered by a UNIX license
should be included.    Reduced prices for bulk orders should be possible if the
total demand is large enough.


                                 Yours sincerely,


                                 John Lions.
