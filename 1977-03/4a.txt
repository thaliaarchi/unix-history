Dear Professor Ferentz,

    A second meeting of UNIX users in Australia was held on February 18th.
at the University of New South Wales, with an attendance of about 30 people.

    During the six months since the first meeting, progress in adapting UNIX
to our needs has been steady but, for the most part, not spectacular.
With most installations being used to capacity, future progress will be very
much tied to further hardware acquisitions.   The news about UNIX is
spreading and we know of several other University groups who are currently
corresponding with Western Electric.

    There was one item of business which will be of general interest.   The
Department of Computing Science at the University of Wollongong which
possesses an  Interdata 7/32 computer,has recently discovered the true path,
and Richard Miller reported on his progress in adapting UNIX to run on their
machine.

    Stage One, to adapt the "C" compiler to produce Interdata object code
has been successful, and apart from the compiler itself, the editor was
the first program recompiled and put into service.    In stage two the
normal UNIX environment for user programs was instituted on a "simulated
machine" running under the Interdata OS/MT operating system.   Stage Three,
which will eliminate the remaining vestiges of Interdata software, should be
completed within about two months.    The one really significant problem
remaining will be how to liberate all those programs still written in
Assembler.      It therefore appears that UNIX may soon have a new claim
to fame as a portable operating system.

    By general agreement the meeting was successful and the third of the
series will be held in July or August.

                                 Yours sincerely,


                                 John Lions.


                                 John Lions.
