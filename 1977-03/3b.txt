        Dear Professor Ferentz:


                       We are in the process of evaluating a system to support
        student terminal usage as the practical part of their computer science
        course.

                       Naturally enough we are concentrating our hopes on a UNIX
        system running on a PDP 11/70.

                       Our benchmark tests are somewhat restricted by the lack
        of large 11/70 configuration in our area, and we are hoping that someone
        somewhere has some pertinent information already available.

                       We are thinking in the range of 32+ terminals, most of whose
        users will be running the same program at any one time.

                       Has anybody any figures for this type of load - response time,
        disk traffic, memory size?  What sort of line printers are suitable -
        with/without DMA controllers?  How many disk controllers/drives - RP06,
        RP04, or of other manufacture?  What are the bottlenecks, if any?  Have
        there been problems with reliability?

                       We would very much appreciate details of real experience.

                       Help us get free of KRONOS:

                                                       Yours sincerely,

                                                       Piers Dick-Lauder
        P.S.  We are hoping you can include
              this plea for information in             Piers Dick-Lauder
              the next issue of UNIX News.
