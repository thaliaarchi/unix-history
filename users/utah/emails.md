> Hi Robert, \
> Thank you for contacting me about the tape you have found.  I'm afraid I can
> claim no explicit recollections regarding any Unix tape.  That said, it is not
> out of the question that I was involved.  When I went to the U at the end of
> 1972 I came as a Research Associate and didn't enroll in the PhD program until
> later in 1973.  In that role I was responsible for the development and
> maintenance of various pieces of equipment in the graphics lab.  I don't
> recall when we took possesion of the PDP-11, but I do recall working with
> Evans and Sutherland on designing and building the first random access video
> frame store for the PDP-11.  I believe the PDP-11 ran an early version of
> Unix, so it would make sense if I was involved with acquiring versions of
> Unix.  When Jim Blinn came to Utah, in 1974 I think, one of his first tasks
> was to develop software that made use of the PDP-11 and E&S frame store to
> create synthetic images.  He may be able to recall, better than I can, some of
> the timeline of the operating system versions we used.  I have copied him on
> this reply. \
> I wish you the best of luck in retreiving Unix v4 from the tape. \
